          <h1>The absolute guide to getting your fixed relative out of a sticky position</h1>
          <p>Our tale begins with three aspiring <span class="strike-through">divs</span> students on their way towards amazing dev careers!</p>
          <div class="the-legendary-beacon you-are-here">
            <div class="student"></div>
            <div class="student"></div>
            <div class="student"></div>
          </div>
          <p>As our team begins to embark on their journey, an oddly dressed senior approaches.</p>
          <p>Smiling brightly, he greets each student with a nod. He then reaches into his magnificent beard and retrieves a scroll decorated with mystical glyphs known as <em>"code"</em>.</p>
          <div class="quote-container">
            <span class="quote-speaker">üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span>
            <blockquote>It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.</blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="snippet-container">
            <span class="snippet-title">[ html ]</span>
            <img src="/assets/page/html-css/scroll-html.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="snippet-container">
            <span class="snippet-title">[ css ]</span>
            <img src="/assets/page/html-css/scroll-css.png" />
          </div>
          <p>The students pondered for a moment, how could they be alone when they stand beside each other?</p>
          <p>Nevermind that they thought to themselves, this guy is giving us free stuff! But... what exactly <strong>is</strong> this gift??</p>
          <div class="conversation">
            <span class="student-c"></span>
            <p>What dark magic is this old man? You speak in tongues!</p>
            <span class="student-a"></span>
            <p>He's not cray cray, that magical jibberish is <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>! It is all around us, our very existence depends on it!</p>
            <span class="student-b"></span>
            <p>Hmmm.. I think this <em>"spell"</em> is about us. What could that <strong>legendary beacon</strong> be about though? It's missing <strong>CSS</strong>!</p>
          </div>
          <h2>--- WIP ---</h2>
          <p>This is a section I lost way too much time to, it was interactive without JS, and meant to demonstrate the different position types through training with the wizard lol.</p>
          <p>Relative and Absolute animations were finished (<span class="highlight">mouse over or tap to see them, 2nd is a bit tricky with mouse</span>). The third one (fixed) I never got to. Or proper responsive CSS for phones.</p>
          <p class="attention">TRY THIS! :)</p>
          <div class="the-legendary-beacon you-are-here lesson-relativity">
            <div class="student astral-project flow-absolute"></div>
            <div class="student levitate"></div>
            <div class="student"></div>
          </div>
          <!-- Switch from width/height to padding? `button` needs `line-height: 0`? -->
          <!-- TODO consider switching from hover to button(:focus/:active),
          <div class="the-legendary-beacon you-are-here lesson-relativity">
            <button class="student astral-project flow-relative"></button>
            <button class="student levitate"></button>
            <button class="student"></button>
          </div>
          -->
          <!-- TODO: Consider alternative to hover other than button -->
          <!-- <input type="checkbox" class="student levitate"></input> -->
          <p>This was for the end of the article, when the devacademy students discover they are the legendary beacon haha (<span class="highlight">mouse over or tap the logo to see the effect</span>).</p>
          <div class="the-legendary-beacon stack-layer-container effect-pulse">
            <div class="student stack-layer"></div>
            <div class="student stack-layer"></div>
            <div class="student stack-layer"></div>
            <img class="circle stack-layer" src="/assets/page/html-css/eda-logo.jpg" />
          </div>
          <p>In the end, I had to cut my losses and know when to quit. I should have approached with content first, then polish if I had time and I wouldn't have stressed so much.</p>
          <p class="attention">NOTE:</p>
          <p>
            <br>- If you're on firefox, the emoji fonts might not look as intended, and some extra eye-candy CSS won't work.
            <br>- If you're on Safari, the ghost animation is a fallback, no squiggly ghost movement for you :(
