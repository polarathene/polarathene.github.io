          <h2>Blocked on a simple problem</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Assisting with a question about an infinite loop / crash.</li>
              <li>A <code>for</code> loop that decrements a countdown to iterate through an array backwards, without using alternative functional methods to do the iteration.</li>
              <li>The browser console was not outputting any <code>console.log()</code> within the loop.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre data-src="/assets/page/problem-solving/snippets/infinite-loop.js" data-range="1,5"></pre>

            <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
            <p>Reproducing locally by trying it with <code>console.log()</code>, but checking for <code>i !== 0</code>, not <code>i &lt; array.length</code>.</p>
            <p>Also MDN docs on the <code>for</code> loop syntax to verify how the condition toggles loop iteration, as I had confused myself when originally trying to help advise with a rubber ducky-like approach :grimacing:</p>
            <p>First simplify the problem with rubber ducky, we can take away the variables and just focus on the values we're starting the loop with:</p>
            <pre data-src="/assets/page/problem-solving/snippets/infinite-loop.js" data-range="13,23"></pre>
            <p>As <code>3</code> is decrementing each loop, the condition will always be <code>&lt; 4</code>, never changing to stop the loop.</p>
            <video autoplay muted loop>
              <source src="/assets/page/problem-solving/strange-bargain.webm" type="video/webm">
              <source src="/assets/page/problem-solving/strange-bargain.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            </video>
            <p>For a sanity check on how the loop condition worked, I wrote a little code to try that wouldn't result in an infinite loop:</p>
            <pre data-src="/assets/page/problem-solving/snippets/infinite-loop.js" data-range="27,39"></pre>
            <p>Success! :partying_face:</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
            <p>Embarrased that I wasn't sure myself, and had to give it a try to verify :joy:</p>
            <p>I also realized that my answer for this exercise was wrong, because I did not read the question properly! (<em>use a <code>for</code> loop that decrements</em>):</p>
            <pre class="language-js"><code>
              countdown.reverse().forEach((item) => console.log(item))
            </code></pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
            <p>The <code>for</code> loop iteration condition will exit the loop when it is no longer <code>true</code>.</p>
            <p>Breaking down the <code>for</code> loop syntax into each iteration as code instead, helped think about what was going on and explain the infinite loop bug better:</p>

          <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
          <section>
            <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
            <p>A game where you change the colours of circles, where each colour was tallied, but was not providing an accurate tally of what the user saw.</p>
            <p>Here was the original code related to the bug:</p>
            <pre data-src="/assets/page/problem-solving/snippets/class-juggling.js" data-range="5,22"></pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
            <p>The cause was found via inspecting the DOM in the browser dev-tools while reproducing the bug.</p>
            <p>Turned out that some circles would have multiple <em>CSS colour classes</em> assigned - when only a single class was expected!</p>
            <p>I wrote a few solutions to try, and discussed different approaches with my peers as we shared what worked for us.</p>
            <p>Later, I thought about taking it a step further. To create a more flexible solution that:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Should not interfere with other CSS classes unrelated to the feature.</li>
              <li>Would not require to copy/paste code across effectively the same function when making updates, or adding support for new colours.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>This was my final solution that I was happy with:</p>
            <pre data-src="/assets/page/problem-solving/snippets/class-juggling.js" data-range="30,52"></pre>
            <ul>
              <li>This function takes a CSS class name and generates a new function variant (as a closure) to return, simplifying function definitions/updates for this feature.</li>
              <li>The array used to create <code>filtered</code> could instead be defined external of the function, or just updated in-place in it's current form when supporting new colour classes. <code>filtered</code> contains all the supported classes, except the one the generated function will handle (<code>classToToggle</code>).</li>
              <li>This isn't an efficient solution as the <code>filtered</code> list gets larger, but I think it's good enough for the purpose and easy enough to understand how it works, that it's an "elegant" solution.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
            <p>Confident.</p>
            <p>Although it took me a while to figure out how to approach the removal nicely. Originally I tried a <code>switch () { ... }</code> statement, but it didn't seem very DRY? <em>(Plus the loop had no context of what not to remove)</em>:</p>
            <pre data-src="/assets/page/problem-solving/snippets/class-juggling.js" data-range="59,85"></pre>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Improving functionality should try avoid over-complicating if the cost of readability outweighs the benefit of the solution.</li>
              <li>A maintainable solution is good enough. Optimizing further should only be considered when there is evidence to support that it would be worth the investment of time and/or added complexity involved.</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Thoughts on various problem-solving techniques</h2>
          <ul class="thought-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Pseudocode:</strong>
              <p>Great way to rough out a plan of attack :+1:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trying something:</strong>
              <p>Very helpful!</p>
              <p>Figuring out how to do portions of the task by learning and trying how to write smaller functionality, and then integrating it all together :sunglasses:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong>
              <p>I find this complements the previous two techniques quite well.</p>
              <p>I often pose some questions, breaking it down and thinking about how to answer those helps quite a bit!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reading error messages:</strong>
              <p>They're magical once you can decipher what they're throwing a fuss about :sweat_smile:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Using <code>console.log()</code>:</strong>
              <p>Praise be to my <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument">Masolow's hammer</a>!</em></p>
              <p>May I bathe in the blissful ignorance of not knowing better debugging tools :joy:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Googling:</strong>
              <p>Almost always reliable <em>(given sufficient time and effort)</em>.</p>
              <p>A solid first step to external assistance before disturbing the living.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>
              <p>One of my last avenues.. and often unfruitful when I've already exhausted previous options.</p>
              <p>However when it's an area of knowledge new to me that isn't too niche, and especially under the pressure of time, I think reaching out sooner has a higher chance of success.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I will seek guidance from peers early, while I investigate and learn solo, getting a response is a bonus :)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>
              <p>This is kind of the same as peers, just more experienced?</p>
              <p>When available, I would reach out when I've been stuck and not having luck with anything else thus far.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong>
              <p>This is quite helpful too.</p>
              <p>I try to reflect afterwards <em>(time permitting)</em>, and write down notes about anything useful, collect some snippets of code or add links related to the topic.</p>
              <p>I may not ever need the information again, or it could be years away and become outdated, but when I do, wow, thank you past me! :heart:</p>
